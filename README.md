## Awesome Possums!
### Awesome Possums adds a new species to the game: Possums!
Adds a new playable species with support for vanilla cosmetics and patterns!

## Requirements
- [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave/tree/main)
- [Lure](https://github.com/Sulayre/WebfishingLure)

## Installation
- Install the required dependencies (See Requirements section)
- Unzip Awesome Possums to your WEBFISHING/GDWeave/mods folder
- Enjoy! :)

## I have an issue!

Please report all issues to the [Issues](https://github.com/lucidinceptor/Awesome-Possums/issues) page for the mod.

- To request support for a modded cosmetic, make an issue using the "mod cosmetic support" tag. (Note that I might not be able to support all cosmetics, but I will try to add any I can when I have the time)
- For issues with base game cosmetics, such as cosmetics not displaying properly on possums, make an issue using the "cosmetic issue" tag. Most should be working but I don't have all of them to test yet.
